This is a Implementation of the Ganjoor poetry website using a custom API and the JS Next framework, along with Typescript, TailwindCss, and Shadcn for full responsiveness. The site features a comprehensive search functionality across all poems, displaying and categorizing all Iranian poets. Each poet has a dedicated page with the ability to play their poems, showcase their works, and display poetic meters.

Additionally, the website includes a login and registration page for user access. The performance has been optimized to achieve up to 80% Lighthouse score, with features such as lazy loading, server-side rendering (SSR), and client-side rendering (CSR). The site also supports both light and dark mode themes.
